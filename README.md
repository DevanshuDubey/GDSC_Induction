# Movie Recommendation System with Collaborative, Content-Based, and Hybrid Filtering

## Overview

This repository contains a **Movie Recommendation System** designed using three recommendation techniques:
1. **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** - Based on user-item interactions, utilizing **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
2. **Content-Based Filtering** - Uses item features (such as movie tags) to recommend similar items.
3. **Hybrid Filtering** - Combines the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering for improved recommendations.

The system is designed to recommend movies to users based on their previous behavior (ratings and tags).

## Key Features

- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends movies similar to the one provided by the user based on tags (genres, keywords).
- **Collaborative Filtering (KNN-based)**: Recommends movies based on similar user preferences (ratings).
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for a more diverse recommendation list.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to interact with the system and get personalized movie recommendations.
